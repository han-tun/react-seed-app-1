SAS files are provided here to enable initial values to be loaded to tables.
This is not the place for TEST data - that should be added as part of
a test suite.

SAS Datalines provide a very concise and controlled way to load data.  Such
programs can be generated using the following utility:

Tables should first be created in WORK then proc appended to the target (CURLIB)
library.
